# Mmatrix_paper

All simulations used the simevolv program (Le Rouzic & RÃ¼nneburger, 2016 : https://github.com/lerouzic/simevolv.git), expected to be in $HOME.

Data are not stored in this repository, but are all reproducible by executing scripts/executables/print_paramfiles.R, launcher/print_launch.sh, then simul/fig-launch.sh.
