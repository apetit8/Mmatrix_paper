# Mmatrix_paper

All simulations used the simevolv program (Le Rouzic & RÃ¼nneburger, 2016 : https://github.com/lerouzic/simevolv.git), expected to be in $HOME. The simulation program path is to change to its location on your machine. It is indicated in the variable SIMUL_PROG of every launcher/print_launch_x.sh file.

Data are not stored in this repository, but are all reproducible by executing scripts/executables/print_paramfiles.R, launcher/print_launch_fig_2ab.sh (each figure has a launcher dedicated), then fig_2ab-launch.sh (or the name of the launch file produced, depending on the launcher used).
